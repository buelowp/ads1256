# ADS1256 in C++ for the Pi and clones

This is an attempt at a simple C++ library for use with C++ projects. It is focused on the High Precision AD-DA board from 
Waveshare and provides a simple interface for using that HAT.

DA services will come at some point. This is being used internally by me and may never become easy to use outside of what I need from it. Just beware.
